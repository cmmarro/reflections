When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A: When you are collaborating with other people, or you want your code accessable via the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	A: If others have contributed to the repository, it would be confusing to have it automatically update your copy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A: Forks are a copy of another person's repository. Clones are a local copy of a remote repository. Branches diverge from the master version of a repository. Use forking if you want to use someone's repository or suggest changes. Clone when you want a local copy of a repository on your computer. Branch when you are working on a side feature or experimental version- possibly to be merged back into the master version later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	A: You can check the difference between your current commit and the latest version.
